In this competition, I worked on predicting used car prices using a dataset filled with valuable information about vehicle characteristics, condition, and sale prices. After analyzing the dataset, I created a model to estimate car prices based on various factors such as year, make, mileage, and more.

ðŸ’» Step-by-Step Breakdown of My Notebook:

Data Exploration and Cleaning:

Explored the dataset to understand the features available and check for missing or erroneous values.
Handled missing data by filling or removing inappropriate entries to ensure a clean dataset for modeling.
Feature Engineering:

Extracted useful features such as car age, brand popularity, and mileage groups.
Created dummy variables to handle categorical data, converting textual information into numerical representations.
Model Selection:

Explored different regression models, starting with Linear Regression as a baseline.
Also tested models such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting for improved accuracy.
Hyperparameter Tuning:

Used GridSearchCV to fine-tune hyperparameters of the models, aiming for optimal performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
Compared results across models and selected the best-performing one based on evaluation metrics.
Final Predictions:

After tuning and evaluating, I generated final predictions on the test dataset and submitted them to Kaggle.
ðŸ“Š Conclusion: By following these steps, I built a robust model for predicting used car prices, which can be valuable for car dealerships, buyers, and sellers to estimate market prices effectively. The insights from the model help understand how different features influence the price, such as car brand, age, and mileage.
